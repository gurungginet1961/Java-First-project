Java Slot Machine
A simple console-based Slot Machine game built in Java. This project demonstrates core Java concepts such as loops, conditionals, methods, arrays, user input handling, and random number generation.

Players start with a balance of $100 and can place bets, spin the slot machine, and win payouts based on the matching symbols.
